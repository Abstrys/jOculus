# Test.md

This is a test markdown file. I'm using it not only to test my writing ability (well, my ability to fill up space with words, at least), but also to test my `.vimrc` file that I just finished editing.

Well, here we are again, and I'm going to type right past the 78th character on this line. Just watch me! In fact, I'll continue to write past the end of the line, and continue more and more until there's nothing left but empty lines.

One of the neat things that .vimrc files can do is apply conditional rules by filetype, by using `if &ft` blocks. For example, from my own `.vimrc`:

~~~~
    autocmd FileType markdown
        \ setlocal sw=4 ts=4 wrap lbr tw=0 wrapmargin=0
~~~~

On an unrelated topic, do you like cats? Here's one:

And there's *this* and **that** and even more things to add!

Why, oh why did I make this program? Is there a purpose to it all? Do I have some kind of mad plan to take people away from using word processors and back to writing in pure text files?

Yes!  Yes, that's it!!  :)

## The purpose

There is a purpose to our lives, I think. Something that drives us forward, and brings us the experiences that we need in order to grow, learn, and realize our ultimate selves.

What it is, however, I have yet to discern. Perhaps that is a purpose we all share?
